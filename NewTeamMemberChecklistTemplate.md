## New Team Member Checklist - Potential Checklist Items

This sample new team member checklist can be used as a starting point for your own list.  Keeping a master list as starting point for a particular new member's list enables a comprehensive and clear starting point for first steps.

The text below can be copied and pasted into a new GitHub issue called `Firstname Lastname Initiation Checklist` in your issues-only repository (note that text is chopped at the right but will be copied).  The `- [ ]` notation will create a checklist item in the issue, which can be used to track progress.
