# Potential Checklist Items

The text below can be copied and pasted into a new GitHub issue called `Firstname Lastname Initiation Checklist` in the [Labora](https://github.com/Collegeville/Labora) issues-only repository (note that text is chopped at the right but will be copied).  The `- [ ]` notation will create a checklist item in the issue, which can be used to track progress.
