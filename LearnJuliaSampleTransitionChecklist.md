## Sample Transition Checklist - Potential Checklist Items

This checklist was created to help a student transition into a new project using the programming language Julia.  Simple checklists like this one can be used to capture important guidance and enable a tangible measure of progress toward a goal.

The text below can be copied and pasted into a new GitHub issue in your issues-only repository (note that text may be chopped at the right but will be copied).  The `- [ ]` notation will create a checklist item in the issue, which can be used to track progress.

```
- [ ] setup Jupyter and julia
