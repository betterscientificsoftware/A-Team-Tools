## New Team Member Sample Welcome

Welcome to the team!  As a new member you will be learning many new topics that are necessary background for you to be a productive project member.  Embrace this opportunity to learn, _and_ be patient! True learning takes enthusiam, effort and time.  There are no short cuts.

### Gettting Started

1. Create a new milestone called `Firstname Lastname Initiation` (e.g., Michael Heroux Initiation) in the project issues-only repository.
1. Copy the contents of [this checklist template file](NewTeamMemberChecklistTemplate.md) into a new issue `Firstname Last Initiation Checklist`.
1. Work with your supervisor to adapt this checklist and create new issues in the issues-only repository that provide the details of how you will complete the checklist.  These topics are what you need to know in order to conduct your research.  Your topics will differ from other team members, so your checklist will be unique.
1. Your first months, and maybe even your first year, will be spent learning the foundational topics that will enable you to perform new research in your subsequent time.
1. Enjoy learning these new topics.  You are getting paid to learn!

Again, welcome to the team!
