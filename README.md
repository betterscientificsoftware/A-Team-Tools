# A-Team-Tools
_A collection of resources for lightweight, agile team management_

This site focuses on simple, lightweight practices to help small software teams (especially research teams) introduce some structure and process to their efforts.  We emphasize a handful of practices we have found to be broadly useful.

## Team Composition

The practices we propose are especially suited to small teams that have both senior and junior members:

- Senior staff, faculty: 
    - Stable presence, in charge of science questions, experiments.
    - Know the conceptual models well.
    - May spend less time writing code, fuzzy on details.

- Junior staff, students:
    - Transient, dual focus (science results, next position).
    - Staged experience: New, experienced, departing.
    - Learning conceptual models.
    - Write most code, know details.

## Key A-Team-Tools Elements

- **Checklists:** We find that checklists enable a uniform, repeatable, trackable and ever-improving system for key events in a team member's participation on a project. The following lists (with links to examples) are particularly useful:
    - [Initiation:](NewTeamMemberChecklistTemplate) Bringing on a new team member occurs often enough to keep a master checklist of potential activities.  From the master list, a custom list can be created as a GitHub issue and assigned to the new team member.
    - [Transition:](LearnJuliaSampleTransitionChecklist) Often during a project a team member (in particular a junior member) will need to learn some new material in order to prepare for their next phase of work.  A transition checklist provides them with the needed concrete steps.  Progress on the checklist is marked by checking off each item as it is completed, showing progress status.
    - [General Exit](TeamMemberExitChecklistTemplate), [Research Student Exit:](ResearchStudentExitChecklistTemplate)
- Policies:
    - How team conducts its work
- Issue tracking system:
    - All work tracked, visible to team
    - Kanban board
    - Regular meetings, updates
